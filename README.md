# 466_project
RNA Secondary Structure Prediction
This application utilizes the CB513 data set, parses it, and uses Viterbi algorithm and Baum Welch to predict the most probable sequence of secondary structures for a given amino acid sequence.

# Running the program:
Run the file called CS466_Final_Project.ipynb. There are two options: 

**Clone Repository:**
- clone the repository
- open <CS466_Final_Project.ipynb> in VS code editor
- Click on Run all Cells

**Run on Google Colab:**
- download <CS466_Final_Project.ipynb> locally
- upload said file on google colab
- Click on Runtime tab and click run all

The last cell prints out the results of the model evaluation.
